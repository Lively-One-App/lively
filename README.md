Through the Lively mobile application, a person can effortlessly connect to the musical stream of their city and, using a special gesture, transition interaction from online to offline, for example, by starting a dance with another person.

Thanks to the counter, you can understand how many people are currently in the Lively stream in your city and see their locations on the map.

Arriving in the musical stream of your city or another, you can collectively engage in various activities, such as dance breaks at work, joint jogging, workouts, yoga, household chores, and so on.

However, Lively will also be great for individual use, allowing you to listen to new music during an evening stroll, while relaxing on the couch, working on the computer, or even dancing alone or in your car on the way home from the office.

Another part of the Lively application, to be released in later versions, is Media, representing real-time media with deep and unwavering values.

The third part is Recommendations, which will be released after Media. The idea is to guide people to fantastic products that will make their lives more interesting. This part of the application will be a source of monetization.

The key scenario of Lively is the most accessible way to connect to the common musical stream of a specific city.

We have reimagined the old, and that is the main innovation of Lively.
